  "prompt": "This seems like classic iron deficiency. But I\u2019ll still do a dietary history and check for occult bleeding if nothing else explains it.",
  "response": "Good clinical reasoning. A dietary history will help rule out iron deficiency as the cause of anemia. If the patient reports a diet lacking in iron-rich foods, further investigation for iron deficiency is warranted. Checking for occult blood is a useful test to rule out gastrointestinal bleeding, which can cause anemia.",
