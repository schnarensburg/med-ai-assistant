  "prompt": "That makes perfect sense. You are right about the diabetes presentation. I agree we should check glucose and HbA1c immediately. What are the normal reference ranges I should use? And what is the next step if the glucose comes back elevated? Should I start treatment right away or wait for additional confirmatory tests? I want to make sure I follow the correct protocol.",
  "response": "Excellent questions! The normal reference range for fasting plasma glucose (FPG) is 70-100 mg/dL (3.9-5.6 mmol/L), and for HbA1c, 20-42 mmol/mol (2-6%). If the FPG is elevated, it indicates diabetes if repeated testing confirms it. Start treatment immediately, including lifestyle modifications and medication as indicated. Follow-up tests may include an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to confirm the diagnosis and assess for other conditions. Remember, diabetes management requires ongoing monitoring and adjustment of treatment based on patient response and HbA1c levels.",
