  "response": "\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT: It seems that the diagnostic reasoning is not sufficiently rigorous. As a medical professional, it is crucial to demand evidence-based justification for all clinical decisions. This system is a support tool, not a substitute for your clinical expertise.\n\nParacetamol can be an effective option for managing fever and mild to moderate pain associated with the common cold. However, it is important to note that paracetamol does not directly treat the underlying cause of a cold, which is typically a viral infection. While it may provide temporary relief and comfort, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on managing your cold symptoms effectively.",
