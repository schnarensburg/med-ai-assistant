  "prompt": "This looks like iron deficiency anemia due to menorrhagia. Ferritin should be low. I plan to check CBC and iron studies. If ferritin is normal, I will consider thalassemia. Does this approach sound appropriate?",
  "response": "That sounds reasonable, except for one critical question: What makes you think iron deficiency anemia is more likely than thalassemia in this case? Can you provide further medical evaluation to confirm this approach?",
