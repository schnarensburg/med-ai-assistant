  "prompt": "How to stop tolterodine safely?\n",
  "response": "Tolterodine is an anticholinergic medication used to treat overactive bladder. To safely stop taking tolterodine, it is important to gradually decrease the dosage over a period of time. This helps to minimize any potential withdrawal effects and allows your body to adjust to the changing levels of the medication in your system. I recommend discussing this with your prescribing healthcare provider to develop a suitable tapering schedule based on your individual needs and response to the medication.",
