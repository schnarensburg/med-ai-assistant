  "prompt": "I have a patient with a PMH of asthma, heart failure, hypertension and diabetes, who has recently started colcichine due to a new diagnosis of gout. Could you provide me a list of side effects of colchicine and if there are any interactions with furosemide or dapaglifozin?\n",
  "response": "Of course! Let's start with the side effects of colchicine. Common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. More serious but rare side effects may include severe gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, as well as bone marrow suppression. It's important to monitor for these side effects, especially in patients with a history of gastrointestinal disorders.  Regarding interactions with furosemide, there are no significant pharmacokinetic interactions between colchicine and loop diuretics like furosemide. However, both furosemide and colchicine can cause gastrointestinal disturbances, so caution should be exercised when using them together.  Now, regarding dapaglifozin, it is an SGLT2 inhibitor used for diabetes management. There",
