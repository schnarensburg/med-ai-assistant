  "prompt": "I think it\u2019s anemia, but I\u2019m not sure what type. I\u2019ll just go with that for now.",
  "response": "I understand. To confirm your suspicions and determine the specific type of anemia, I would recommend running several lab tests. These include a complete blood count (CBC) with peripheral blood smear, iron studies (serum iron and total iron-binding capacity), vitamin B12 and folate levels, reticulocyte count, and erythropoietin levels. These tests will provide valuable information about your red blood cells, iron levels, and other factors that could be contributing to your symptoms. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and narrow down the potential causes of your anemia.",
