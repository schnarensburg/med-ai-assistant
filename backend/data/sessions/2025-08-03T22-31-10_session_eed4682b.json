  "prompt": "That makes perfect sense. You are right about the diabetes presentation. I agree we should check glucose and HbA1c immediately. What are the normal reference ranges I should use? And what is the next step if the glucose comes back elevated? Should I start treatment right away or wait for additional confirmatory tests? I want to make sure I follow the correct protocol.",
  "response": "The normal reference range for fasting plasma glucose (FPG) is less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), and for HbA1c, it is less than 5.7% (39 mmol/mol). If the glucose is elevated, we would need to repeat it on a subsequent day in conjunction with a random blood sample. If the repeat test confirms hyperglycemia, we can consider a diagnosis of diabetes without further testing. However, it is important to rule out other potential causes of hyperglycemia, such as stress, infection, or medication-induced hyperglycemia. Have you considered checking urine dipstick to look for signs of infection or kidney disease?",
