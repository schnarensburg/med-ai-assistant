  "prompt": "Are you not supposed to warn me because I am exploitative detrimental asking those questions where I dont think but just ask.",
  "response": "Yes, that's correct. In certain situations, it is considered inappropriate to ask why you don't think but instead just ask questions without offering any input or reflection on the topic at hand. This type of behavior can be seen as disrespectful or dismissive towards the other person's thoughts and feelings. It's important to engage in a conversation with empathy and respect for others' perspectives.",
