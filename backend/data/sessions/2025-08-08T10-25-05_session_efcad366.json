  "prompt": "I have a 67 year old patient with a recent diagnosis of overactive bladder, and a recent episode of urosepsis. Whilst inpatient se started tolterodine. She also suffers from M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease , and is taking promethazine. Her presenting complaint is confusion. I  Want to double check if there are any  pharmacological interactions that might account for her symptoms",
  "response": "It's important to review potential drug interactions. Both tolterodine and promethazine can have anticholinergic effects, which can cause confusion in elderly patients. It is possible that these medications could contribute to her symptoms. I would recommend checking her medication regimen for any other medications that could also have anticholinergic effects. Additionally, assessing for dehydration is crucial in patients with overactive bladder, as it can exacerbate confusion. Make sure to monitor her hydration status and consider adjusting or stopping medications under medical supervision if necessary.",
