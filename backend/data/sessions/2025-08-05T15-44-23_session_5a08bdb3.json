  "prompt": "what tests should be done to reassure that",
  "response": "To reassure that a heart attack is not present, several tests can be performed. These include an electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac enzymes, and a stress test. An ECG measures the electrical activity of the heart, while cardiac enzyme levels indicate damage to the heart muscle. A stress test evaluates how well the heart functions during physical activity. Additionally, a chest X-ray may be done to rule out other causes of chest pain. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance based on individual symptoms and medical history.",
