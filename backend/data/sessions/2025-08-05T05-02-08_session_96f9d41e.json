  "prompt": "You're absolutely right about the diabetes. I agree we should test glucose immediately. What's the standard HbA1c threshold for diagnosis? Should I start metformin right away if it's confirmed?",
  "response": "The standard HbA1c threshold for diagnosis of diabetes is 6.5% or higher. Starting metformin is generally recommended as part of the initial management for most patients with type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not preferred by the patient. It's important to individualize treatment based on patient characteristics and preferences, so discussing this with your colleague is key.",
