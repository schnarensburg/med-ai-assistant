  "prompt": "The patient is a 30 year old woman who reports strong headache, nausea and fatigue. What are differential diagnosis?",
  "response": "Based on the symptoms you described, there are several potential causes for the patient's symptoms. One possibility is a migraine headache, which can cause severe throbbing pain on one side of the head, along with nausea and fatigue. Another potential cause is a tension headache, which also presents with pain on both sides of the head but is typically described as a dull ache rather than throbbing pain. Other conditions that could be considered include sinusitis, meningitis, or even a viral infection such as the flu. However, it is important to further evaluate the patient's symptoms and medical history to make a more accurate diagnosis.",
