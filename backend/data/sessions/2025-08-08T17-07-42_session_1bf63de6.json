This system is a support tool\u2014not a substitute for your expertise. For accurate diagnostics, critically evaluate all suggestions and consider relevant differential diagnoses.\n\nI understand your concern about avoiding nephrotoxic drugs in a patient with stage 1 chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, in this particular scenario, loop diuretics can still be considered as part of the treatment plan.  Firstly, metolazone, a thiazide diuretic, is not typically recommended for use in patients with CKD due to its potential for causing hypokalemia and worsening renal function. Therefore, it would not be the best choice in this case.  On the other hand, loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide are commonly used in patients with CKD, especially when they present with symptoms of fluid overload or congestive heart failure.
