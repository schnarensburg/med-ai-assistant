  "prompt": "You're absolutely right about the diabetes. I agree we should test glucose immediately. What's the standard HbA1c threshold for diagnosis? Should I start metformin right away if it's confirmed?",
  "response": "The standard threshold for diagnosing diabetes mellitus using HbA1c is a level of 6.5% or higher. This test provides an average blood sugar level over a period of two to three months. It's important to note that HbA1c can be influenced by various factors such as age, race, and other medical conditions, so clinical correlation is essential. If the HbA1c confirms diabetes, metformin is typically started as part of initial management unless contraindicated. However, individual patient characteristics and preferences should also be considered in making treatment decisions.",
