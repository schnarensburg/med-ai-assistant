  "prompt": "That makes perfect sense. You are right about the diabetes presentation. I agree we should check glucose and HbA1c immediately. What are the normal reference ranges I should use? And what is the next step if the glucose comes back elevated? Should I start treatment right away or wait for additional confirmatory tests? I want to make sure I follow the correct protocol.",
  "response": "The normal fasting glucose range is typically between 70-100 mg/dL. A random glucose level over 200 mg/dL with symptoms of hyperglycemia is suggestive of diabetes. If the random glucose is elevated, I would recommend repeating it in a fasting state to confirm a diagnosis of diabetes. Additionally, checking HbA1c can provide a longer-term picture of blood sugar control. Treatment for hyperglycemia should not be delayed if there is clear evidence of hyperglycemia and a high suspicion for diabetes. However, it is important to consult with a physician for further evaluation and to discuss appropriate treatment options based on the individual's overall health and clinical presentation.",
