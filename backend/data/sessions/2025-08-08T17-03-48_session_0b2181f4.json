  "response": "\u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL WARNING: Current reasoning appears overly focused on a single diagnosis, with limited independent clinical analysis. This system is a support tool\u2014not a substitute for your expertise. For accurate diagnostics, critically evaluate all suggestions and consider relevant differential diagnoses.\n\nColchicine is an anti-inflammatory medication that can be effective in reducing gout symptoms. The amount of time it takes for colchicine to improve symptoms varies from person to person and depends on various factors like the severity of symptoms, individual response to the medication, and adherence to the treatment plan. It is generally recommended to take colchicine at the first sign of a gout flare and continue taking it until symptoms have completely resolved. Typically, colchicine can start reducing pain within hours, but it may take up to a few days to fully alleviate symptoms. However, it is important to note that individual responses to medications can vary, so it is always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your specific condition.",
